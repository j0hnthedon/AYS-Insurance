      <h1>Understanding Medicare Supplement: Your Guide to Medigap Plans</h1>
      <p>
        If you’re new to Medicare, you might have heard about Medicare Supplement,
        also known as Medigap Plans. Let’s break it down to make it simple and
        straightforward.
      </p>

      <h2>What is Medicare Supplement (Medigap Plan)?</h2>
      <p>
        A Medicare Supplement, also known as a Medigap policy, is sold by private
        insurance companies to cover costs not covered by Original Medicare. These
        costs include deductibles, copayments, and coinsurance. Unlike Medicare
        Part C plans, each Medigap plan is standardized. A plan G, for instance, will
        mirror any Plan G available on the market covering Medicare benefits the
        exact same way, with the only difference being pricing and any additional
        benefits an insurer may offer.
      </p>

      <h2>How does Medicare Supplement Work?</h2>
      <p>
        A Medicare Medigap Plan works will only supplement Original Medicare. Once
        Original Medicare is billed, the supplement will pay its portion to the Medicare
        contracted provider based on the Plan you choose. A point of note: A
        Medicare beneficiary can NOT be enrolled in both a Medicare Advantage plan
        and Medicare Part C. It can only be paired with a Medicare Part D plan.
        <ol style="list-style-type: none;">
          <li>
            <h3>Enrollment</h3>
            <p>
              A Medicare beneficiary who has both Part A and Part B can
              enroll in a Medicare supplement at any time; however, the optimal time to
              enroll is during open enrollment period or any other time guarantee issue
              rights are available.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Open Enrollment Period (OEP) for a Medigap plan begins on the 1 st day
              of the month you are both 65 or older and enrolled in Medicare Part B and
              lasts for 6 months. During Medigap OEP, an insurance company can NOT
              use medical underwriting to decide whether to accept your application, refuse
              to sell you any plan it offers, charge you more for the plan, or make you wait
              for the coverage to start. The only caveat, a pre-existing condition waiting
              period may apply if the insured was not covered at any time during the
              previous six months before enrolling in a Medigap policy or the coverage was
              not creditable, meaning it was not as good as Medicare’s coverage. If a
              waiting period is required, the insurer will not cover certain services for 6
              months; however, Medicare will still cover its portion.
            </p>
            <p>
              Guaranteed Issue Rights offers the right to buy certain Medigap policies.
              During this time, an insurance company must sell you a Medigap policy, cover
              all your pre-existing health conditions, and not charge you an additional
              premium for the plan. Medicare beneficiaries that qualify for guarantee issue
              rights must act quickly as it is a time sensitive election, so act quickly. Some
              triggers to activate guaranteed issue rights are loss of current coverage,
              moving to a new service area your plan doesn’t cover, or trial rights under a
              Medicare Advantage Plan. Keep in mind, you will need to submit proof of prior
              coverage to activate this election period, so keep your documentation handy.
              Outside of OEP and the Guaranteed Issue Rights, a Medicare beneficiary
              can enroll in a Medicare Supplement at any time and will be subjected to
              medical underwriting. This process will determine if your application is
              accepted by the insurance company, if they will require a pre-existing
              condition waiting period, and if an additional premium will be required.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Choosing the Right Plan</h3>
            <p>
              There are many factors to consider when
              choosing the right plan, like costs, your current and future health and needs.
              This is critical as some insurers will not allow plan changes without medical
              underwriting.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Costs</h3>
            <p>
              Each insurance company decides how it’ll set the pricing for its
              Medicare Supplement Plans; therefore, different insurance companies may
              charge different amounts for exactly the same Medigap policy. All premiums
              will increase based on inflation and other factors; however, the three rating
              systems determine how pricing and annual increases are assessed:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Attained Age rated plans are based on your current age, meaning your
                premiums increase as you age. Generally, these plans are initially less
                expensive, but will usually become the most expensive.
              </li>
              <li>
                Community rated (no age-rated) plans generally charge the same premium to
                everyone, but there is no increase based on age. A 65 and 70-year old will
                pay the same base rate in monthly premium.
              </li>
              <li>
                Issue-age rated (entry age-rated) plans charge premiums based on the age
                you purchase the plan, so a person who purchases the plan at age 65 will pay
                less than a 70-year old who purchases the same plan on the same day. The
                increase in premium will also not be based on age.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </p>

      <h4>Monthly Premium</h4>
      <p>
        The actual monthly premium is based on how the plans
        are rated, the percentage or amount of Original Medicare costs the plan will
        cover, discounts, male/female classifications, smoker/non-smoker
        classifications, current age, whether (or not) underwriting is required and other
        factors.
