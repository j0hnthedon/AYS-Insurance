    <h1>Learn About Medicare</h1>

    <h3>A Brief History of Medicare</h3>
    <p>
      Medicare's history began in 1964 when President Lyndon B. Johnson asked Congress to create the program. In 1965, Congress passed legislation to create Medicare as part of the Social Security Amendments, and on July 30th , Pres. Johnson signed the bill into law. The signing ceremony took place in Independence, Missouri, with former President Harry S. Truman in attendance. Medicare services began on July 1, 1966, and more than 19 million Americans aged 65 and older enrolled. Before Medicare, only about half of people over 65 had some form of hospital insurance, and few of those had coverage for surgical and out-of-hospital physician costs. Over time, Medicare was expanded to include more disabilities and provisions for prescription drug coverage.
