      <h1>Medicare Costs</h1>
      
      <h3>Understanding Medicare Cost for 2025</h3>
      <p>
        Navigating Medicare costs in 2025 can feel overwhelming, but our
        comprehensive guide makes it easy to understand what you can expect.
        Whether you’re new to Medicare or looking to update your plan, we’ve got you
        covered.
      </p>

      <h3>What Are the Medicare Costs for 2025</h3>
      <p>
        Medicare costs can vary based on the specific parts of Medicare you enroll in:
        Part A, Part B, Part C, and Part D. Here’s a breakdown of each:
      </p>


          <h4>Medicare Part A (Hospital Insurance)</h4>
              <h5>Premiums:</h5>
              <p>
                Most people don’t pay a monthly premium for Part A if they or
              their spouse paid Medicare taxes while working a minimum of 40 quarters. If
              required to pay a premium, the standard premium for 2025 can range from
              $285 to $515 per month.
              </p>

      <div style="text-align: center;">
        <strong >
              At the time you receive services from a medical provider or facility, the costs
            are as follows:
            </strong>
      </div>
            
            
              <h5>Deductibles:</h5>
              <p style="text-align: center;">
                The Part A Hospital deductible is $1,676 per benefit period.
              </p>
              <h5>Coinsurance:</h5>
              <p>
                After the deductible, you pay $0 for the first 60 days of
                inpatient hospital care. From day 61-90, it’s $419 per day, and after 90 days,
                it’s $838 per “lifetime reserve day”. For skilled nursing services, day 1-20 is
                generally a $0.00; however, at day 21-100, the copayment is $209.50 per day.
                For day 101 and beyond, you are responsible for all costs. Hospice care is
                generally $0; however, a copayment of up to $5 may apply for each
                prescription drug. For inpatient respite care related to hospice care, 5% of the
                Medicare approved amount is your coinsurance amount.
              </p>
        
          <h4>Medicare Part B (Medical Insurance)</h4>
              <h5>Premiums:</h5>
              <p>
                The standard monthly premium for Part B in 2025 is $185.00,
                but it can be higher based on your income. The surcharge you may pay for
                Medicare Part-B is referred to as the <b>Income Related Monthly Adjustment
                Amount.</b>
              </p>

            <p>
              At the time you receive services from a medical provider or facility, the costs are as follows:
            </p>
            
              <h5 >Deductibles:</h5>
              <p style="text-align: center;">
                The annual deductible for Part B is $257.
              </p>
              <h5>Coinsurance:</h5>
              <p>
                After meeting the deductible, you typically pay 20% of the
                Medicare-approved amount for most doctor services, outpatient therapy, and
                durable medical equipment. Medicare-covered laboratory tests are $0
                copayment.
              </p>


          <h4>Medicare Part C (Medicare Advantage)</h4>
              <h5>Premiums and Costs:</h5>
              <p>
                These vary widely depending on the plan and
                provider. Medicare Advantage plans often offer additional benefits beyond
                Original Medicare, which can impact overall costs. Keep in mind, you must
                continue to pay your Medicare Part B premium even if you choose to enroll in
                a Part C plan. Please read “Medicare Part C” under the “Additional Coverage”
                tab for more information.
              </p>


          <h4>Medicare Part D (Perscription Drug Coverage)</h4>
              <h5>Premiums and Other Out-of-Pocket Costs:</h5>
              <p>
                Part D premiums, deductibles,
                copayments, and coinsurance depend on the plan you choose and can vary
                significantly. Please read “Medicare Part D” under the “Additional Coverage”
                tab for more information.
              </p>
      
          <h4>Medicare Supplement (Medigap)</h4>
              <h5>Premiums and Other Out-of-Pocket Costs:</h5>
              <p>
                Medicare Supplement premiums, deductibles, copayments, and coinsurance depend on the
                plan you choose and can vary significantly. Please read “Medicare Supplement” under
                the “Additional Coverage” tab for more information.
              </p>

      <h5>Factors Affecting Your Medicare Costs</h5>
      <p style="text-align: center;">
        Your specific Medicare costs can be influenced by several factors:
      </p>

          <h5>Late Enrollment Penalties (LEP):</h5>
          <p style="text-align: center;">
            A <b>Late Enrollment Penalty</b>, can be
            charged on Part B and Part D.
          </p>
          <h5>Part B's Late Enrollment Penalty</h5>
          <p>
            If you don’t sign up for Medicare Part B when you are initially eligible and don’t
            have other creditable medical coverage (like an employer plan), you may be
            charged a <b>Late Enrollment Penalty (LEP)</b>. You will pay an extra 10% for
            each full year you could have signed up for Part B, but didn’t. This is a lifetime
            penalty unless you qualify for financial assistance from the State.
          </p>
          <h5>Part D's Late Enrollment Penalty</h5>
          <p>
            If at any time after you qualify for Medicare Part A or B and your Initial
            Enrollment Period is over, there is a period of 63 consecutive days or more
            that you don’t have creditable prescription drug coverage, you may be
            assessed a <b>Late Enrollment Penalty</b>. This penalty will be assessed by
            Medicare and will be charged to you each month you have Medicare drug
            coverage. Currently, Medicare calculates it by multiplying 1% of the national
            base beneficiary premium ($36.78 in 2025) times the number of full,
            uncovered months you did not have creditable drug coverage. This is a
            lifetime penalty unless you qualify for financial assistance from the State.
          </p>
          <h5>Income:</h5>
          <p>
            Higher income can lead to higher premiums for Part B and Part D.
            This additional surcharge, referred to as the <b>Income Related Monthly
            Adjustment Amount (IRMAA)</b>, is calculated by Medicare. It is based on your
            reported income from 2 years prior. After <b>IRMAA</b> is calculated, the adjusted
            monthly premium for Part B is as follows:
          </p>
          <img src="/PhotoAssests/2025Medicare.png" alt="tax-img1" class="tax"
            style="max-width: 70%;">
      
          <p>
            If you are assessed an <b>IRMAA</b> for Medicare Part B, you will be charged an
            additional premium for Medicare Part D, as well. The additional premium is
            indicated in the table below.
          </p>
      
          <img src="/PhotoAssests/2025Medicare-pt2.png" alt="tax-img2" class="tax" style="max-width: 70%;">

        <h3>How to Lower Your Medicare Costs</h3>
        <li>
          <h5>Review Your Plan Annually:</h5>
          <p>
            Medicare plans and costs change yearly.
            Make sure to review your plan during the Annual Enrollment Period (October
            15 – December 7) to ensure it meets your needs.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h5>Consider a Medicare Advantage Plan:</h5>
          <p>
            These plans often offer extra benefits and 
            can sometimes be more cost-effective than Original Medicare.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h5>Apply for Assistance Programs:</h5>
          <p>
            Programs like Medicaid, the Medicare
            Savings Program, and Extra Help can assist with premiums, deductibles, and
            drug costs for those who qualify.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>
