    <h1> Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

    <ul>
      <h3>Do you need to enroll in Medicare?</h3>  
      <li>
        If you or your spouse has insurance coverage from current employment, you may keep it in most cases and apply for Medicare at a later time without penalty. Confirm with your employer that your coverage is creditable, meaning it is as good as Medicare or better.
      </li>
      <li>
        If you are enrolled in an Affordable Care Act plan, you must enroll in Medicare when initially eligible.
      </li>
      <li>
        If you are uninsured, you should enroll in Medicare when initially eligible.
      </li>
      <li>
        If you have Veteran Affairs benefits, it depends.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Is there a cost for Medicare?</h3>
    <p>
      For most people, Medicare Part A is available premium free. Medicare Part B always has a premium. In some cases, the state may pay the premium for you. 
    </p>

    <h3>Are my medical services free after I enroll in Medicare?</h3>
    <p style="text-align: center;">
      No, Medicare is designed to cover about 80% of your medical costs. You will be responsible for any amount not covered by Medicare.
    </p>

    <h3>Is there a fee for your services?</h3>
    <p style="text-align: center;">
      No, there is no fee for our services.
    </p>

    <h3>How are you compensated?</h3>
    <p>
      We are 100% commissioned based and compensated after your enrollment, by the insurance provider you choose. We have no preferred insurance provider and will be compensated equally no matter which company you choose. The Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services regulates pay to agents.
    </p>

    <h3>Will my benefits be diminished if I choose a Medicare Advantage plan?</h3>
    <p>
      No! By law, Medicare Advantage plans must cover all services provided by Original Medicare. Plus, Medicare Advantage plans generally offer value-added benefits Original Medicare doesn’t cover.
    </p>

    <h3>
      I have a discount card for prescriptions, which is adequate right now. Do I need Medicare Prescription Drug coverage, too? 
    </h3>
    <p>
      Yes, as it is not insurance. You will generally pay a Late Enrollment Penalty (LEP) if you choose Medicare Prescription Drug coverage at a later time. You can avoid this penalty if you have other coverage equal to other better than Medicare’s coverage.
    </p>

    <h3>Can I pair a Medicare Supplement with a Medicare Advantage Plan?</h3>
    <p style="text-align: center;">
      No, a Medicare Supplement can only be paired with a prescription drug plan, not a Medicare Advantage Plan.
